# EEPROM module

## Redundant Module VPD Support

POWER processors are equipped with several redundant EEPROM sections,
and in particular, redundant Module VPD sections. For P9 and before,
accesses to Module VPD EEPROM sections, along with failover to
redundant parts, were done by the service processor.

For P10, Hostboot is required to perform its own accesses to these
EEPROM sections, and support redundant hardware. This support is
currently implemented at the EEPROM Device Driver (DD) level by means
of a table which specifies how a single "virtual" EEPROM access (read
or write) should be decomposed into one or more "physical" EEPROM
accesses.

### Physical and Virtual EEPROM Devices

To perform an EEPROM operation through the Device Driver, the caller
must specify the EEPROM device they want to access, along with other
parameters. This EEPROM device is defined by a pair of enumeration
values: (1) the EEPROM "role" (that is, primary VPD, backup VPD, WOF
data, etc.), and (2) the EEPROM "source" (EECACHE, hardware).

For the purposes of this document, the Driver supports accesses to
what can be conceptualized as two kinds of EEPROM devices: "physical"
and "virtual." Physical data sources exist in memory or on SEEPROM
hardware as storage of actual data, and are designated by using both a
physical EEPROM role, like "VPD_PRIMARY" and a physical EEPROM source,
like "HARDWARE."

Virtual devices refer to one or more physical devices, such that
accessing a virtual device may access one or more physical devices. A
virtual device is designated by using either a virtual role or a
virtual source. The Driver supports one virtual role, which is the
"auto" VPD role. The Driver supports two virtual sources, which are
the "cache" and the "autoselect" sources. (The "cache" source is
unusual in that it meets the definition for a virtual source and also
a physical source, since e.g. writes to VPD cache will be mapped to
both to cache and hardware by the translation process).

The Device Driver translates virtual accesses into physical accesses
using a table of rules, each entry containing a role/source pattern
and a set of operations. At the beginning of an EEPROM operation, the
Driver will search the table to check whether a rule in the table
matches the access being performed. If so, the dispatcher will execute
the operations specified by the rule. If not, the access is performed
as-is. Only the first matching rule is executed. The operations
specified by a rule in the table will also be checked in the table.

### Hardware Failure Tolerance

When performing EEPROM operations, the Device Driver consults an
attribute called ATTR_EEPROM_VPD_ACCESSIBILITY which may exist on the
target being accessed. The attribute is a bitmask which specifies
which EEPROM devices have malfunctioned. If a bit is set in the
bitmask, the Driver will not attempt to access the corresponding
device until a re-IPL resets the value of the attribute. When an
operation fails, the Driver will update the bitmask on the target.
Note that the device representing the EECACHE entry is treated no
differently than a SEEPROM.

An EEPROM access fails when none of the attempted accesses to physical
EEPROM devices succeed. This can happen because one or more accesses
fail, or because no accesses were attempted (i.e. all devices had
failed before and were masked in the accessibility attribute).

### HBRT VPD Update Flow

When system state is at Hostboot Runtime, writes
to the PNOR Partitions are -NOT- permitted (on FSP systems),
e.g. PNOR EECACHE partition.

Hostboot owns the VPD/EEPROM content (processor
module seeproms and DDIMM SPD).

Hostboot as the owner of the EEPROMs can write
directly to the SEEPROM hardware (as well as
to the in memory eecache content).

If writes are made to the VPD/EEPROM content
at HBRT, the PNOR EECACHE partition needs
to be synchronized at the next IPL when writes
to the PNOR EECACHE partition is allowed (either
at the next full IPL or the next MPIPL).

To faciliate the synchronization, the
attribute EECACHE_VPD_STATE tracks the flag
which identifies if the target is out-of-sync,
i.e. EECACHE_VPD_STATE_VPD_NEEDS_REFRESH.

During IPL and MPIPL flows, the targets will
be queried and if the flag triggers a
forced synchronization to update the PNOR EECACHE
partition the sync will be completed.

On FSP systems there is also the need to
communicate any VPD updates made during HBRT
to the FSP to allow the FSP to update the FSP's
VPD cache (which is outside the control of Hostboot).

During HBRT (for FSP based systems) a sendMboxWriteMsg
will be sent to the FSP.  FSP receives this message
and updates the FSP VPD cache.  The target's attribute
EECACHE_VPD_STATE is persisted across IPL/MPIPL
which allows the Hostboot handling of the PNOR EECACHE
partition synchronization to occur.

The following information is provided as a point-in-time aide for the
above example flow to identify how the HUID and RID map in relationship
to each other.  The PHYP writepvd command uses the HUID, the FSP svpdMFGTool
command uses the RID.
